# Help Me With Money!

With the steady decline of late-stage capitalism, money management is a popular topic these days. It’s no longer enough to have a job in a “stable” industry. There are hundreds of websites, books, and podcasts offering tips, techniques, and tricks on how to make your money make money.

But what if good enough is all you want? Navigating the terrain of financial topics when you’re content with just getting by is nigh impossible. There are a lot of strange terms to understand, and often someone is trying to sell you something to help _them_, not you.

This website will give a very direct introduction on how to handle your money. It’s not going to teach you how to be rich or how to budget your expenditures. It will instead guide you on the types of accounts you should have for intermediate and long-term saving goals. (It should be noted that most of the advice here is directed at individuals with accounts in the USA.)
