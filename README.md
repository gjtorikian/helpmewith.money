# Help Me With Money!

With the steady decline of late-stage capitalism, money management is a popular topic these days. It's no longer enough to have find a job in a "stable" industry. There are hundreds of websites, books, and podcasts offering tips on how to make your money make money.

But navigating the terrain of these topics is difficult. There are a lot of strange terms to understand, and often the information is very terse. How does one get started from the beginning?

The purpose of this website is to give a very direct introduction how to handle your money. It's not going to teach you how to be rich or how to budget your expenditures. It will instead guide you on the types of accounts you should have for intermediate and long-term saving goals.  It should be noted that most of the advice here is directed at individuals with accounts in the USA.
