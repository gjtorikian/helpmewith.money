<p class="lh-copy mb4">With the steady decline of late-stage capitalism, money management is a popular topic these days. It&rsquo;s no longer enough to have find a job in a &ldquo;stable&rdquo; industry. There are hundreds of websites, books, and podcasts offering tips on how to make your money make money.</p>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">But navigating the terrain of these topics is difficult. There are a lot of strange terms to understand, and often the information is very terse. How does one get started from the beginning?</p>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">The purpose of this website is to give a very direct introduction how to handle your money. It&rsquo;s not going to teach you how to be rich or how to budget your expenditures. It will instead guide you on the types of accounts you should have for intermediate and long-term saving goals.  It should be noted that most of the advice here is directed at individuals with accounts in the USA.</p>

<hr />

<p class="lh-copy mb4">Let&rsquo;s start by defining <strong>the most important term</strong> when it comes to personal finance.</p>

<h3 class="mt4 mb4 tc ttu tracked fw3" id="compound-interest">Compound interest</h3>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">Claimed to be &ldquo;the most powerful force in the universe,&rdquo; compound interest is fundamental to understanding how money works in this world. Interest is simply a percentage amount that is applied to a chunk of money, usually monthly or annually. It can work for and against you.</p>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">Consider this: you have $10,000 in an online savings account. The bank offers you 1% interest over a year, which means that, if you kept the money in there without modifying it, you should have <a href="javascript:;" data-tippy="1% of $10,000 is $100" data-tippy-arrow="false" data-tippy-distance="0"class="link tooltip relative green bw1 bb--dashed">an additional $100 after one year</a>. Now, why do banks do this? Is it out of the goodness of their hearts? Not at all. While you park your money within a bank, the bank is, at the same time, loaning that money to additional customers. Your money is always &ldquo;there,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s not always yours. To &ldquo;thank&rdquo; you for keeping your money in the account, the bank offers an interest rate, to incentivize you to keep your money with them, as opposed to under your mattress. If you keep that $10,100 in the account and continue leaving it alone, in another year&rsquo;s time you should have <a href="javascript:;" data-tippy="1% of $10,100 is $101" data-tippy-arrow="false" data-tippy-distance="0"class="link tooltip relative green bw1 bb--dashed">$10,201</a>.</p>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">Similarly, assume you buy something on a credit card that&rsquo;s worth $10,000. You have been <strong>loaned</strong> that amount of money; you <strong>must</strong> pay it back. The credit card company might place a 25% monthly interest fee on anything you owe. Which means, if you don&rsquo;t repay the full $10,000 that you borrowed in a month, the credit card company will expect <a href="javascript:;" data-tippy="25% of $10,000 is $12,500" data-tippy-arrow="false" data-tippy-distance="0"class="link tooltip relative green bw1 bb--dashed">$12,500 the next month</a>. Worse, if you don&rsquo;t pay back that $12,500, you will owe <a href="javascript:;" data-tippy="25% of $12,500 is $3,125" data-tippy-arrow="false" data-tippy-distance="0"class="link tooltip relative green bw1 bb--dashed">$15,625 the month after</a>.</p>

<p class="lh-copy mb4"><em>That&rsquo;s</em> the power of compound interest. Over a set amount of time, the money grows by a set percentage. The more money you start with, the greater the amounts returned by interest increase.</p>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">Let&rsquo;s introduce two more terms.</p>

<h3 class="mt4 mb4 tc ttu tracked fw3" id="stocks">Stocks</h3>

<div class="dt center">
  <div class="db tc dtc-ns v-mid-ns">
    <img src="stocks.jpg" alt="Men trading stocks" />
  </div>
  <div class="db dtc-ns v-mid pr0-ns pl3-ns">
    <p class="lh-copy mb4 mw7">
      You're probably generally familiar with what stocks are: a financial activity primarily dominated by men with very little melanin. Buying a stock grants you ownership of a company. When a business is just starting, they want as many investors as possible, so that they can have money to operate. After a while, their business grows and makes money on its own, but strong stock growth is indicative of a healthy business.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">Stocks are traded on the stock market. After you buy a stock, if that company succeeds, you are often paid <em>dividends</em> as a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; for your investment. (This is, essentially similar to how a bank operates: in exchange for giving your trust vis-à-vis an investment, you are rewarded as the business grows.) If the company fails, however, you do not recuperate any of the money you spent on stocks. (Unless you happen to be <a class="link green" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/28/highest-paid-ceos-bailed-out-recession">an executive</a> at that company.) Stocks are <em>high risk</em>, because you don&rsquo;t know if a business will succeed or fail, but they are also <em>high reward</em>, because their growth has the potental to increase your wealth.</p>

<h3 class="mt4 mb4 tc ttu tracked fw3" id="bonds">Bonds</h3>

<div class="dt center">
  <div class="db tc dtc-ns v-mid-ns">
    <img src="bonds.jpg" alt="Captain America urging you to buy war bonds" />
  </div>
  <div class="db dtc-ns v-mid pr0-ns pl3-ns">
    <p class="lh-copy mb4 mw7">
      The best way to describe a bond is to think of it as a loan, except you act as the bank. When you buy a bond, what you're actually doing is loaning money, either to your city, state, or national government. They in turn promise to pay you back, with regular interest payments. Bonds may be used to do anything from fund local transit projects to covering budget deficits.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">Bonds are considered <em>low risk</em>, because governments typically pay back their creditors. (If a government collapses and defaults on its repayment, there are far worse problems at stake.) Although you are paid back some percentage of interest, it&rsquo;s a relatively <em>low reward</em> for the amount of risk you&rsquo;re taking.</p>

<hr />

<p class="lh-copy mb4">A reasonable balance of owning stocks and bonds, along with the power of compound interest, is fundamental in growing your assets.</p>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">With all of that understood, let&rsquo;s look at some things you can do with your money, in order.</p>

            </section>
            
            
            
            <section class="ph0-l ph0-m ph4">
              
              <h2 class="mt4 mb4 tc">Step 1: Pay off all your debt</h2>
              
              <p class="lh-copy mb4">No one is saying that this first step is easy, but it is undoubtedly the most important move to make: pay off any debt you hold immediately.</p>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">As suggested by the section on compound interest above, credit card companies charge astronomically high interest rates. That $10,000 purchase you made could cost you an additional $2,500 <em>at best</em>, if you don&rsquo;t pay it back on time. The easiest way to not owe additional money is to not spend money that you don&rsquo;t have. Of course, sometimes this is inevitable. You may need to borrow money to go to school, or to purchase a car that you need in order to commute to work. Sometimes, this is called &ldquo;good debt,&rdquo; because the theory is that these &ldquo;purchases&rdquo; will lead to better opportunities for more revenue. For example, by going to school, you&rsquo;ll be able to land a high-paying job you couldn&rsquo;t get otherwise; or, with a new car, you&rsquo;ll get better gas mileage and be able to afford further commutes for work.</p>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">While incurring debt in order to make money is a reasonable thing to do (&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to spend money to make money&rdquo;), <strong>there is no such thing as &ldquo;good debt.&rdquo;</strong> Having student loan payments to make does not place you in a better financial position. You will continue to pay extra money for a decision you made several years ago, for no reason, other than a lopsided capitalist system that seeks to punish you for attempting to advance yourself with higher education. Again, this kind of debt is often inevitable. But you should focus on paying it down as soon as possible, by meeting or exceeding your minimum payment accounts, however you can. Why should you pay an extra $20,000 on something that already cost $100,000?</p>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">And it should go without saying: once you&rsquo;re out of debt, don&rsquo;t get back into it. Deeply consider whether a purchase that sends you back into debt will be a wise investment.</p>

            </section>
            
            
            
            <section class="ph0-l ph0-m ph4">
              
              <h2 class="mt4 mb4 tc">Step 2: Maximize 401(k) contributions</h2>
              
              

<p class="lh-copy mb4">With debt out of the way (hooray!), it&rsquo;s time to introduce a few more terms:</p>

<h3 class="mt4 mb4 tc ttu tracked fw3" id="taxable-accounts">Taxable accounts</h3>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">These are accounts which are taxed every year at tax season. They include savings accounts, money market mutual funds, and so on. Every year, when your accounts grow due to interest, you must pay taxes on that profit.</p>

<h3 class="mt4 mb4 tc ttu tracked fw3" id="tax-free-accounts">Tax-free accounts</h3>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">These are accounts which are similar to taxable accounts in that there are a weird assortment of options. However, every year, when these accounts grow due to interest, you <em>do not</em> pay taxes on that profit.</p>

<h3 class="mt4 mb4 tc ttu tracked fw3" id="tax-deferred-accounts">Tax-deferred accounts</h3>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">These are accounts most commonly associated with retirement plans. Every year, when these accounts grow due to interest, you <em>do not</em> pay taxes on that profit. <em>However</em>, when it is time for you to retire, and you begin to withdraw funds from these accounts, you must pay taxes on the amount you withdraw.</p>

<hr />

<p class="lh-copy mb4">When it comes to taxes, an extremely simplified summation of these three accounts would be:</p>

<ol>
<li>With <em>taxable accounts</em>, taxes are paid on the interest every year.</li>
<li>With <em>tax-free account</em>, taxes are never paid on the interest.</li>
<li>With <em>tax-deferred accounts</em>, taxes are paid on the interest at a later date.</li>
</ol>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">At this point, you might think that that tax-free bucket seems pretty tempting! After all, your money can grow over time and you don&rsquo;t have to pay any taxes on that profit. But, as with all things, there&rsquo;s a catch, and we&rsquo;ll get to that later.</p>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">For right now, let&rsquo;s talk about tax-deferred accounts. Now, some places of employment offer a 401(k) plan. Assuming you are fortunate enough to be offered this, you should take advantage of it. But what is it?</p>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">A 401(k) plan is a type of tax-deferred account primarily associated with retirement. Crucially, a 401(k) account is funded <em>pre-tax</em>. Every month, your employer taxes a percentage of your gross pay and places it into your 401(k) plan. Often, they will also offer a &ldquo;match,&rdquo; which is basically free money. The beauty of a pre-tax tax-deferred account is that you can save quite a lot of money with very little effort.</p>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">For example, let&rsquo;s say you make $3,000 a month, before taxes. You decide to contribute 10% of your paycheck each month into your 401(k). Your employer also decides to contribute 1% of any contribution you make into your 401(k). In one month, you will contribute <a href="javascript:;" data-tippy="10% of $3,000 is $300" data-tippy-arrow="false" data-tippy-distance="0"class="link tooltip relative green bw1 bb--dashed">$300</a>; your employer will also contribute <a href="javascript:;" data-tippy="1% of $300 is $3" data-tippy-arrow="false" data-tippy-distance="0"class="link tooltip relative green bw1 bb--dashed">$3</a>. Now, after taxes, that $3,000 is actually going to be <a href="javascript:;" data-tippy="Assuming a tax rate of 15%, 15% of $3,000 is $450; $3,000 minus $450 is $2,550" data-tippy-arrow="false" data-tippy-distance="0"class="link tooltip relative green bw1 bb--dashed">closer to $2,550</a>. If you contributed to your 401(k) after taxes, your 10% contribution would amount to <a href="javascript:;" data-tippy="10% of $2,550 is $255" data-tippy-arrow="false" data-tippy-distance="0"class="link tooltip relative green bw1 bb--dashed">$255</a>; your employer will also contribute <a href="javascript:;" data-tippy="1% of $255 is $2.55" data-tippy-arrow="false" data-tippy-distance="0"class="link tooltip relative green bw1 bb--dashed">$2.55</a>.</p>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">Not only does paying into a 401(k) before taxes provide a greater contribution, it also provides a higher employer match as well. The money in this account will grow without tax consequences, so it makes the most sense to fund this bucket as early and as quickly as possible.</p>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">However, there is a limit to the amount of money you can save in a 401(k) plan. In 2019, the maximum contribution for a 401(k) plan is $19,000. This maximum tends to change every few years by about $500, so if you&rsquo;re reading this some time in the future, be sure to check what your upper limit is!</p>

              <h2 class="mt4 mb4 tc">Step 3: Maximize your savings</h2>
              
              <p class="lh-copy mb4">You have no debt and you&rsquo;ve started some basic saving for retirement. Now it&rsquo;s time to build up your emergency account.</p>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">This account should only be used for unexpected expenditures, such as repairs to a bicycle, medical bills, or if you suddenly find yourself unemployed. A good rule of thumb is to save about six to twelve months of your monthly gross income. For example, if every month you spend $1,000, have an account somewhere with <a href="javascript:;" data-tippy="6 times $1,000 is $6,000" data-tippy-arrow="false" data-tippy-distance="0"class="link tooltip relative green bw1 bb--dashed">at least $6,000 stored in it</a>. Tilt towards the higher end of the &ldquo;six to twelve&rdquo; rule if you&rsquo;re either particularly nervous.</p>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">Save this money in a high-yield savings account. Brick-and-mortar banks usually provide abysmally low interest rates. Online-only accounts, such as <a class="link green" href="https://www.ally.com/bank/online-savings-account/">Ally</a> or <a class="link green" href="https://www.capitalone.com/bank/savings-accounts/">Capital One</a> offer much better rates.</p>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">There&rsquo;s not much else to add here! Keep in mind that if you&rsquo;re having trouble funding your savings account, you probably shouldn&rsquo;t send money towards other locations, such as mutual funds or other investments. The good news is that once you&rsquo;ve hit your number, you won&rsquo;t have to keep adding funds in here. In fact—don&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s no advantage to saving more, and you could get that money working in smarter ways.</p>

            </section>

              <h2 class="mt4 mb4 tc">Step 4: Maximize IRA contributions</h2>
              
              <p class="lh-copy mb4">With your 401(k) steadily growing, you might think you&rsquo;re all set for retirement.</p>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">But you&rsquo;re not! Saving for retirement is just about the best thing you can do, because you never know what the future will hold. Because of the magic power of compound interest, the more you save (and the earlier you save it), the more money you can expect to collect when you need to.</p>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">To that end, once you&rsquo;ve set up a savings account, you can start funding an IRA. There are two kinds to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>A traditional IRA (tIRA). The amount you fund into a tIRA can be tax deductible, but ultimately, any earnings in a tIRA is considered to be tax-deferred&ndash;you&rsquo;ll pay taxes when you withdraw later.</li>
<li>A Roth IRA is a tax-free account. Any contribution you add grows without any tax consequences.</li>
</ul>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">In 2018, the maximum IRA contribution limit is $5,500, and that&rsquo;s across <em>both</em> accounts, meaning that you if you add $1,000 to one account and $4,500 to another account, <a href="javascript:;" data-tippy="$1,000 plus $4,500 is $5,500" data-tippy-arrow="false" data-tippy-distance="0"class="link tooltip relative green bw1 bb--dashed">you&rsquo;ve hit your limit</a>.</p>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">Here&rsquo;s where another tax-free &ldquo;gotcha&rdquo; kicks in: because a tax-free account is so appealing, not everyone can contribute to them every year. In 2018, if you make over $133,000 a year, you cannot contribute to a Roth IRA.</p>

              <p class="lh-copy mb4">If, <em>and only if</em>, you&rsquo;ve completed all the other steps, you can begin to consider contributing to other accounts. Growth on these sorts of accounts are taxed every year, but, unlike retirement accounts, you can use them however you see fit.</p>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">What other types of investments are there? Plenty. Although you could choose to invest in individual stocks, a much more sound financial strategy would involve investing in &ldquo;a stock of stocks,&rdquo; or a mutual fund. Just as buying a single share grants you a single sliver of ownership in a single company, buying a share in a mutual fund grants you a silver of ownership across whatever companies the mutual fund tracks.</p>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">Stock growth in a single company may be astronomical, but they are also more risky as they are much more suspectible to fall. A popular mutual fund option is ownership in the S&amp;P 500, which tracks the top 500 U.S. companies. As businesses succeed and decline, a mutual fund tracking the S&amp;P 500 will adjust its holdings accordingly. Thus, by definition, you are always guaranteed ownership in the most successful companies. This doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ll always be making money, but you do beat holding individual stocks in one key difference: the market always goes up.</p>

      Although daily, weekly, and monthly fluctuations in the market occur <em>all the time</em>, the only true statement that can be made is that, over enough years, the market always trends up. A crash in the market may take two (or five, or more) years to recover, but it <em>does</em> recover. If a company flounders and fails, there's no guarantee that it will recover.

              <h2 class="mt4 mb4 tc">Addendum I: What do I invest in, and how much?</h2>
              
              <p class="lh-copy mb4">Up until now, we&rsquo;ve discussed what sort of accounts you should have, but we haven&rsquo;t talked about where you should put your money. That&rsquo;s because this is entirely based on personal choices. There&rsquo;s no one-size-fits-all solution. The advice above is good information to guide you towards your goals, but <strong>only you know what those goals are</strong>. The savings plans for a twenty-two year old might not be the same plans for a fifty-five year old who is much closer to retirement!</p>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">Still, there&rsquo;s a general balance that can be struck for your asset allocation between stocks and bonds. A reasonable rule of thumb is to hold a percentage of &ldquo;120 minus your age&rdquo; in stocks, and the rest in bonds. For example, <a href="javascript:;" data-tippy="120 minus 35 is 85" data-tippy-arrow="false" data-tippy-distance="0"class="link tooltip relative green bw1 bb--dashed">if you are 35, you could have 85% of your assets in stocks, and 15% in bonds</a>. As you grow older, you are less likely to take on the risk of losing money, and so you need to rebalance your holdings to ensure that more of it goes out of stock holdings and into bonds.</p>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">If you don&rsquo;t want to constantly rebalance (and no one will blame you), Vanguard has <a class="link green" href="https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/target-retirement/#/">Target Retirement Funds</a> to make the process much easier. The funds are named based on your age of retirement, and the holdings are automatically adjusted as time goes on. For example, <a class="link green" href="https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/portfolio/vthrx">the 2030 fund</a> has a <sup>70</sup>&frasl;<sub>30</sub> stock/bond mix, while <a class="link green" href="https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/portfolio/vlxvx">the 2065 fund</a> has a <sup>90</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> split.</p>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">If you&rsquo;re able to take on more risk, or simply want your own custom ratios, that&rsquo;s totally fine! You could take a look at holding stock in <a class="link green" href="https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VTSAX">VTSAX</a> or <a class="link green" href="https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/overview/vfiax">VFIAX</a> mutual funds. Both track the entire stock market. The former tracks companies of many different sizes, while the latter only tracks the aforementioned S&amp;P 500.</p>

<p class="lh-copy mb4">For bonds, you could go with <a class="link green" href="https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VBTLX">VBTLX</a>, which invests in both corporate and government bonds. Or you could try <a class="link green" href="https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VTWSX">VTWSX</a>, which also introduces holdings in international bonds.</p>
