With debt out of the way (hooray!), it's time to introduce a few more terms:

### Taxable accounts

These are accounts which are taxed every year at tax season. They include savings accounts, stock market funds, and so on. Every year, when your accounts grow due to interest, you must pay taxes on that profit.

### Tax-deferred accounts

These are accounts most commonly associated with retirement plans with difficult names such as _401(k)_ or _IRA_. Every year, when these accounts grow due to interest, you _do not_ pay taxes on that profit. _However_, when it is time for you to retire, and you begin to withdraw funds from these accounts, you must pay taxes on the amount you withdraw.

### Tax-free accounts

These are accounts which are almost exclusively for a special kind of retirement account called a _Roth IRA_. _However_, every year, when these accounts grow due to interest, you _do not_ pay taxes on that profit.

When it comes to taxes, an extremely simplified summation of these three accounts would be:

1. With _taxable accounts_, taxes are paid on the interest every year.
2. With _tax-deferred accounts_, taxes are paid on the interest at a later date.
3. With _tax-free account_, taxes are never paid on the interest.

At this point, you might think that that tax-free bucket seems pretty tempting! After all, your money can grow over time and you don't have to pay any taxes on that profit. But, as with all things, there's a catch, and we'll get to that later. For right now, let's talk about tax-deferred accounts.

Some places of employment offer a 401(k) plan. Assuming you are fortunate enough to be offered this, you should take advantage of it. But what is it?

A 401(k) plan is a type of tax-deferred account primarily associated with retirement. Crucially, a 401(k) account is funded _pre-tax_. Every month, your employer taxes a percentage of your gross pay and places it into your 401(k) plan. Often, they will also offer a "match": for every amount you put in, the employer will also contribute some set percentage of your contribution.  **This is basically free money.** The beauty of a pre-tax tax-deferred account is that you can save quite a lot of money with very little effort.

For example, let's say you make $3,000 a month, before taxes. You decide to contribute 10% of your paycheck each month into your 401(k). Your employer also decides to contribute 1% of any contribution you make into your 401(k). In one month, you will contribute <tooltip tooltip="10% of $3,000 is $300">$300</tooltip>; your employer will also contribute <tooltip tooltip="1% of $300 is $3">$3</tooltip>. $303 may not seem like much, but with compound interest, the bigger the number, the more you end up with.

What if pre-tax dollars weren't considered? After taxes, that $3,000 is actually going to be <tooltip tooltip="Assuming a tax rate of 15%, 15% of $3,000 is $450; $3,000 minus $450 is $2,550">closer to $2,550</tooltip> every month. If you contributed 10% of your after-tax pay, that contribution would amount to <tooltip tooltip="10% of $2,550 is $255">$255</tooltip>; your employer will also contribute <tooltip tooltip="1% of $255 is $2.55">$2.55</tooltip>.

Not only does paying into a 401(k) before taxes provide a greater contribution, it also provides a higher employer match as well. The money in this account will grow without tax consequences, so it makes the most sense to fund this bucket as early and as quickly as possible.

However, there is a limit to the amount of money you can save in a 401(k) plan. In 2019, the maximum contribution for a 401(k) plan is $19,000. This maximum tends to change every few years by about $500, so if you're reading this some time in the future, be sure to check what your upper limit is!
