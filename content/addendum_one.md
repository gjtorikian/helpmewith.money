Up until now, we've discussed what sort of accounts you should have, but we haven't talked about where you should put your money. That's because this is entirely based on personal choices. There's no one-size-fits-all solution. The advice above is good information to guide you towards your goals, but **only you know what those goals are**. The savings plans for a twenty-two year old might not be the same plans for a fifty-five year old who is much closer to retirement!

Still, there's a general balance that can be struck for your asset allocation between stocks and bonds. You want to own stocks because, over time, they will grow; and you want to own bonds because you are much less likely to lose money with them. A reasonable suggestion is to hold a percentage of "120 minus your age" in stocks, and the rest in bonds. For example, <tooltip tooltip="120 minus 35 is 85">if you are 35, you could have 85% of your assets in stocks, and 15% in bonds</tooltip>. As you grow older, you are less likely to take on the risk of losing money, and so you need to rebalance your holdings to ensure that more of it goes out of stock holdings and into bonds.

If you don't want to constantly rebalance (and no one will blame you), Vanguard has [Target Retirement Funds](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/target-retirement/#/) to make the process much easier. The funds are named based on your age of retirement, and the holdings are automatically adjusted as time goes on. For example, [the 2030 fund](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/portfolio/vthrx) has a 70/30 stock/bond mix, while [the 2065 fund](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/portfolio/vlxvx) has a 90/10 split.

If you're able to take on more risk, or simply want your own custom ratios, that's totally fine! You could take a look at holding stock in [VTSAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VTSAX) or [VFIAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/overview/vfiax) mutual funds. Both track the entire stock market. The former tracks companies of many different sizes, while the latter only tracks the aforementioned S&P 500.

For bonds, go with [VBTLX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VBTLX), which invests in both corporate and government bonds. Or you could try [VTWSX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VTWSX), which also introduces holdings in international bonds.
