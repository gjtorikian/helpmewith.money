[JLCollin's stock series](https://jlcollinsnh.com/stock-series/) breaks down strategies for handling your assets into digestable chunks. It's very highly recommended.

[The Bogleheads forum](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/index.php) is an essential place for more information on the content described above. The Bogleheads are extremely welcoming to new and advanced investors alike. Some of the material on this site can be visualized over at the "[Tax-efficient fund placement](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax-efficient_fund_placement#Assigning_asset_classes_to_different_accounts)" article on the Bogleheads wiki.

For more information on that, check The Mad Fientist's [post on "After-tax Contributions"](https://www.madfientist.com/after-tax-contributions/).
