If, _and only if_, you've completed all the other steps, you can begin to consider contributing to other accounts. Growth on these sorts of accounts are taxed every year, but, unlike retirement accounts, you can use them however you see fit.

What other types of investments are there? Plenty. Although you could choose to invest in individual stocks, a much more sound financial strategy would involve investing in "a stock of stocks," or a mutual fund. Just as buying a single share grants you a single sliver of ownership in a single company, buying a share in a mutual fund grants you a silver of ownership across whatever companies the mutual fund tracks.

Stock growth in a single company may be astronomical, but they are also more risky as they are much more suspectible to fall. A popular mutual fund option is ownership in the S&P 500, which tracks the top 500 U.S. companies. As businesses succeed and decline, a mutual fund tracking the S&P 500 will adjust its holdings accordingly. Thus, by definition, you are always guaranteed ownership in the most successful companies. This doesn't mean you'll always be making money, but you do beat holding individual stocks in one key difference: the market always goes up.

Although daily, weekly, and monthly fluctuations in the market occur <em>all the time</em>, the only true statement that can be made is that, over enough years, the market always trends up. A crash in the market may take two (or five, or more) years to recover, but it <em>does</em> recover. If a company flounders and fails, there's no guarantee that it will recover.
