If, _and only if_, you've completed all the other steps, you've somehow achieved the near-impossible, and you can begin to consider contributing to other accounts. Growth on these sorts of accounts are taxed every year, but, unlike retirement accounts, you can use that money whenever you want, not just when you retire.

What other types of investments are there? Plenty. Although you could choose to invest in individual stocks, a much more sound financial strategy would involve investing in "a stock of stocks," or a mutual fund. Just as buying a single share grants you a single sliver of ownership in a single company, buying a share in a mutual fund grants you a silver of ownership across whatever companies the mutual fund tracks.

Stock growth in a single company may be astronomical, but they are also more risky as they are much more susceptible to fall. A popular mutual fund option is ownership in the S&P 500, which tracks the top 500 U.S. companies. As businesses succeed and decline, a mutual fund tracking the S&P 500 will adjust its holdings accordingly. Thus, by definition, you are always guaranteed ownership in the most successful companies. This doesn't mean you'll always be making money, but you do beat holding individual stocks in one key difference: the market always goes up.

Although daily, weekly, and monthly fluctuations in the market occur <em>all the time</em>, the only true statement that can be made is that, over enough years, the market always trends up. A crash in the market may take two (or five, or more) years to recover, but it <em>does</em> recover. If a company flounders and fails, there's no guarantee that it will recover.

If you do invest in stocks, don't even think about selling them until at least five to ten years. The market will go down and up and down again, and if you buy a stock at $100 a share, and watch it fall to $75, you might be tempted to sell in order to prevent further loses.

Don't. You cannot time the market. No one can. Who's to say that that $75 won't become $110 in another few months? As the chart above shows, _with enough time_, you are likely to come out on top. Invest in taxable accounts only if you're certain you won't need that money in the near future.

For a great read on how "staying in the market" can benefit you, read "[What if You Only Invested at Market Peaks?](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2014/02/worlds-worst-market-timer/)", which uses math and actual stock trends over the last forty years to demonstrate the above points.
