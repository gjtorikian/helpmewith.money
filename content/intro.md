With the steady decline of late-stage capitalism, money management is a popular topic these days. It's no longer enough to have a job in a "stable" industry. There are hundreds of websites, books, and podcasts offering tips, techniques, and tricks on how to make your money make money.

But what if good enough is all you want? Navigating the terrain of financial topics when you're content with just getting by is nigh impossible. There are a lot of strange terms to understand, and often someone is trying to sell you something to help _them_, not you.

This website will give a very direct introduction on how to handle your money. It's not going to teach you how to be rich or how to budget your expenditures. It will instead guide you on the types of accounts you should have for intermediate and long-term saving goals. (It should be noted that most of the advice here is directed at individuals with accounts in the USA.)

Let's start by defining **the most important term** when it comes to personal finance.

### Compound interest

Claimed to be "the most powerful force in the universe," compound interest is fundamental to understanding how money works in this world. Ancient Romans reviled the idea as an immoral loan that benefited the lender, but Western society warmed up to the concept by the 17th century. Compound interest is just a percentage amount that is applied to a chunk of money, usually monthly or annually. It can work for and against you.

Consider this: you have $10,000 in an online savings account. The bank offers you 1% interest over a year, which means that, if you kept the money in there without touching it, you should have <tooltip tooltip="1% of $10,000 is $100">an additional $100 after one year</tooltip>. Now, why do banks do this? Is it out of the goodness of their hearts? Not at all. While you park your money within a bank, the bank is, at the same time, loaning that money to additional customers. Your money is always "there," but it's not always yours. To "thank" you for keeping your money in the account (and allowing them to use it), banks offer an interest rate to incentivize you to keep your money with them (as opposed to under your mattress). If you keep that $10,100 in the account and continue leaving it alone, in another year's time you should have <tooltip tooltip="1% of $10,100 is $101">$10,201</tooltip>. Thus, the longer you hold on to your money, the more it grows.

Similarly, assume you buy something worth $10,000 using a credit card. You have been **loaned** that amount of money by a loan shark; you must pay it back. To "incentivize" you to pay it as quickly as possible, the credit card company places a 25% monthly interest fee on anything you owe. Which means, if you don't repay the full $10,000 that you borrowed in a month, the credit card company will expect <tooltip tooltip="25% of $10,000 is $12,500">$12,500 the next month</tooltip>. If you don't pay back that $12,500, you will owe <tooltip tooltip="25% of $12,500 is $3,125">$15,625 the month after</tooltip>. (Note that credit card companies don't actually want you to pay this back as quickly as possible; the longer you wait, the more you owe them.)

_That's_ the power of compound interest. Over a set amount of time, money grows by a repeating percentage. The more money you start with, the greater the amounts returned.

Let's introduce two more terms.

### Stocks

You're might already be familiar with what stocks are: a financial activity primarily dominated by men with very little melanin. Buying a stock grants you ownership of a company. When a business is just starting, they want as many investors as possible, so that they can have money to operate. After a while, their business grows and makes money on its own. Strong stock growth is indicative of a healthy business.

Stocks are traded on the stock market. After you buy a stock, if that company succeeds, you are paid _dividends_ four times a year as a "thank you" for your investment. (This is essentially similar to how a bank operates: in exchange for giving your trust vis-Ã -vis an investment, you are rewarded as the business grows.) The more stocks you own, the more dividends you receive. If the company fails, however, you do not recuperate any of the money you spent on stocks. (Unless you happen to be [an executive](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/28/highest-paid-ceos-bailed-out-recession) at that company.) Stocks are _high risk_, because you don't know if a business will succeed or fail, but they are also _high reward_, because their growth has the potential to pay high dividends.

### Bonds

The best way to describe a bond is to think of it as yet another loan, except you yourself are the bank. When you buy a bond, what you're actually doing is loaning money, either to your city, state, or national government. They in turn promise to pay you back, with regular interest payments. Bonds may be used to do anything from fund local transit projects to covering budget deficits.

Bonds are considered _low risk_, because governments typically pay back their creditors. (If a government collapses and is unable to make a repayment, there are far worse problems at stake.) Although you are paid back some percentage of interest, it's a relatively _low reward_ for the amount of risk you're taking. Still, the interest returned from a bond is often greater than the interest returned by a bank, so they're more financially sound for growing money long-term.

A reasonable balance of owning stocks and bonds, along with the power of compound interest, is fundamental in growing your assets.

With all of that understood, let's look at some things you can do with your money, in order.
