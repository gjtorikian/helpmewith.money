With your 401(k) steadily growing, you might think you're all set for retirement.

But you're not! Saving for retirement is just about the best thing you can do, because you never know what the future will hold. Because of the magic power of compound interest, the more you save (and the earlier you save it), the more money you can expect to collect when you need to.

To that end, once you've set up a savings account, you can start funding an IRA. There are two kinds to consider:

* A traditional IRA (tIRA). The amount you fund into a tIRA can be tax deductible, but ultimately, any earnings in a tIRA is considered to be tax-deferred--you'll pay taxes when you withdraw later.
* A Roth IRA is a tax-free account. Any contribution you add grows without any tax consequences.

In 2019, the maximum IRA contribution limit is $6,000. Unlike a 401(k), both IRA types are funded with after-tax money, presumably because the government would prefer that you continue working well past retirement.

If you've been following along, you would correctly believe that the Roth IRA is way better than the traditional IRA. But here's where another tax-free "gotcha" kicks in: since a tax-free account is so appealing, not everyone can contribute to them. If your income level exceeds a certain amount, you are forbidden by law from contributing to a Roth. In 2019, for example, if you're single and make over $137,000 a year, you cannot contribute to a Roth IRA. Check the federal "MAGI" laws for more information.
