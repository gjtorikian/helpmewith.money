You have no debt and you've started some basic saving for retirement. Now it's time to build up your emergency account.

This account should only be used for unexpected expenditures, such as repairs to a bicycle, medical bills, or if you suddenly find yourself unemployed. A good rule of thumb is to save about six to twelve months of your monthly gross income. For example, if every month you spend $3,000, have an account somewhere with <tooltip tooltip="6 times $3,000 is $9,000">at least $9,000 stored in it</tooltip>. Tilt towards the higher end of the "six to twelve" rule if you're either particularly nervous or your job situation is unstable.

Save this money in a high-yield savings account. Brick-and-mortar banks usually provide abysmally low interest rates. Online-only accounts, such as [Ally](https://www.ally.com/bank/online-savings-account/) or [Capital One](https://www.capitalone.com/bank/savings-accounts/), offer much better rates.

Keep in mind that if you're having trouble funding your savings account, you shouldn't send money in other purchases or frivolous investments in bitcoin. The good news is that once you've hit your number, you won't have to keep adding funds in here. In factâ€”don't. There's no advantage to saving more, and you could get that money working in smarter ways.
