No one is saying that this first step is easy, but it is undoubtedly the most important move to make: pay off any debt you hold immediately.

As suggested by the section on compound interest above, credit card companies charge astronomically high interest rates. That $10,000 purchase you made could cost you an additional $2,500 _at best_, if you don't pay it back on time. The easiest way to not owe additional money is to not spend money that you don't have. Of course, sometimes this is inevitable. You may need to borrow money to go to school, or to purchase a car that you need in order to commute to work. Sometimes, this is called "good debt," because the theory is that these "purchases" will lead to better opportunities for more revenue. For example, by going to school, you'll be able to land a high-paying job you couldn't get otherwise; or, with a new car, you'll get better gas mileage and be able to afford further commutes for work.

While incurring debt in order to make money is a reasonable thing to do ("You've got to spend money to make money"), **there is no such thing as "good debt."** Having student loan payments to make does not place you in a better financial position. You will continue to pay extra money for a decision you made several years ago, for no reason, other than a lopsided capitalist system that seeks to punish you for attempting to advance yourself with higher education. Again, this kind of debt is often inevitable. But you should focus on paying it down as soon as possible, by meeting or exceeding your minimum payment accounts, however you can. Why should you pay an extra $20,000 on something that already cost $100,000?

And it should go without saying: once you're out of debt, don't get back into it. Deeply consider whether a purchase that sends you back into debt will be a wise investment.
